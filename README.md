# Nobel Prize Winners Data Analysis
 
**Repository Purpose:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of Nobel Prize winners across disciplines and time.  
**Technology Stack:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook

---

## Overview

This repository explores historical trends, demographic insights, and category distributions within the Nobel Prize dataset. The notebook `Nobel Prize Winners.ipynb` performs data preprocessing, statistical summarization, and rich visual storytelling to uncover patterns among Nobel laureates.

The project highlights how prestigious global recognition has evolved over time—by gender, nationality, age, and discipline.
